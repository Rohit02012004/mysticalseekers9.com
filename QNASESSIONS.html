                    <p>Q. What holds people back from doing what they want to do?</p>
                    <p>Ans- Nothing. It is just that they don't want it bad enough.</p>
                    <p>Q. How does one gets absolutely involved in what he is doing?
                        U mentioned that your personality is fluid and you change it accordingly as needed, how do you do this??</p>
                        <p>Ans- If you are not entangled in your head, naturally you'll be involved.
                        But your head can't shut up because you think you are too smart.
                        If you don't think too much of yourself, you'll naturally shut up and you'll be naturally Involved.
                        </p>
                    <p>Q. How does one gets absolutely involved in what he is doing?
                        U mentioned that your personality is fluid and you change it accordingly as needed, how do you do this??</p>
                        
                    <p> Ans - In my childhood, I realized that "I am not my personality".
                        Because I could easily change my Mindset, Personality, Voice... 
                        Because I just kept silent and looked, I learnt so many personalities.
                        Once you learn deeply, you can change your Mindset, Personality...
                        That's one way to truly realize that you are not your personality.
                        But if you do "Personality Development", then you'll be a stone of a personality and you'll keep yourself in an illusion that you are your personality.
                        </p>    
                    <p>Q. Bhaiya, can you please tell me the difference between desperation and extremely strong desire!?</p>
                    <p>Ans-If you are desperate, you can't desire strong.
                        Because to get to the stage where your desire could be really strong, you must be stable, patient and calm within you. 
                        Those who are not stable become Desperate.
                        Those who are extremely stable can Desire Strongly.
                        </p>    
                    <p>Q. How to get out of thoughts related to myself?</p>
                    <p> Ans- *Realize* that you are stupid.
                        Don't *believe* you are stupid - that'll do nothing but depress you.
                        </p> 
                    <p>Q. Do I really need to follow someone?</p>
                    <p>Ans- I don't know what do you mean by Follow. But definitely you need to keep learning.
                        </p>      
                    <p>Q. How to adapt with situation faster and move on from past?</p>
                    <p> Ans-_*See more than you think*_</p> 
                    <p>Q.Osho said, there is nothing to do, nowhere to go, all goals without exeption are useless. 
                        Can you elaborate this pls?
                        But the nature of life is evolution, always expanding.As sadhguru says, strive to go beyond physical.
                        But it is said then the success of sadhana is to realise there is nowhere to go.
                        Im confused!</p>
                        
                    <p>Ans- Indeed there is nowhere to go.
                        Where will YOU go?
                        Your body can go from here to there.
                        Body can grow, change, improve, Upgrade...
                        Mind can too...
                        That's physical.
                        But where will YOU go?
                        </p>
                    <p>Q. Bhaiya what's your vision , why you're giving us these amazing things for free??</p>
                    <p>Ans- No I am not giving you anything for Free.
                        I am just hoping that you will Enhance your life and the lives of other people.
                        If you don't, I won't force you but me telling you all this will go waste.
                        </p>    
                    <p>Q. Why do I always give in to other people's opinions? What they are doing and saying sometimes influences me so much that I may have fear, get angry/agitated, get happy, etc. This happens a lot with the people whom I respect and follow and not so much with other people.</p>
                    <p>
                        Ans-You respect and follow the wrong people.
                        If you have "truly" followed one at least sensible person, this wouldn't be happening with you.</p>
